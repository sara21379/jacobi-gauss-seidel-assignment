# Iterative Solver - Jacobi & Gauss-Seidel

This project implements an iterative method for solving a system of linear equations.  
Two numerical methods are included:
- Jacobi Method
- Gauss-Seidel Method

The system is hardcoded into the program, and the user can choose which method to apply.  
The program checks for diagonal dominance and attempts to rearrange the matrix if needed.  
All iterations are printed until the stopping condition is reached (epsilon = 0.00001).
